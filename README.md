# Mobile Payment System Based on Public-Key Security Technology

## Project Overview

This project explores the security technologies used in mobile payment systems, particularly in China. It focuses on public-key encryption and its application in mobile payments, which have become a critical component of e-commerce due to their convenience and low cost. The goal is to ensure the security of information during transactions, especially with the increasing use of mobile payments over traditional methods.

## Introduction

Mobile payments have revolutionized the way we exchange value, replacing traditional forms like cash, checks, and credit cards. This project investigates how mobile payment systems can secure transactions using public-key encryption technology. Public-key encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt and access the transaction data, safeguarding sensitive information.

## System Model

We studied three functional modes within the mobile payment ecosystem:

1. **Mobile Operators**: Payments are deducted from the userâ€™s prepaid account based on their mobile number. No involvement from banks.
2. **Banks**: The bank connects to the mobile account, providing a platform for users to make payments through their bank accounts.
3. **Third-Party Service Providers**: These providers act as a bridge between retailers, banks, and mobile network operators.

Each mode plays a crucial role in ensuring the functionality and security of mobile payments.

## System Structure

The Mobile Payment System (MPS) consists of two main components:

1. **Mobile Payment Agent (MPA)**: Responsible for administration, accounting, and communication on a national level, connected to the Business Operation Support System (BOSS).
2. **Mobile Payment Platform (MPP)**: Responsible for local administration, accounting, and communication, linked to service providers.

## Security Mechanism

Mobile payment security is ensured through encryption techniques. We explored two primary encryption methods:

### Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. While efficient, it requires both the sender and receiver to share the same key, which can pose security risks if the key is compromised.

- Examples: AES, DES, IDEA, Blowfish

### Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This method offers a higher level of security, as the private key is never shared.

- Example: RSA

## Application of Public-Key Cryptosystem in QR Codes

QR codes are widely used in mobile payment systems to facilitate secure transactions. In this project, we applied public-key cryptography to secure data transmitted via QR codes.

### Key Concepts of QR Codes:
- **Finder Pattern**: Helps locate the position of the QR code.
- **Timing Pattern**: Allows the decoder software to determine the width of each module.
- **Error Correction**: Ensures that data can be recovered even if part of the QR code is damaged.

We explored how data is encoded, masked, and decoded within QR codes and discussed how public-key cryptography ensures secure mobile payments.

## Encoding and Decoding QR Codes

### QR Code Generation
QR codes are generated by encoding data into a 2D matrix. Data is stored in the "data" section, while the "error correction" section ensures that data can be recovered if the QR code is damaged.

### Error Correction
There are four levels of error correction in QR codes: Low (L), Medium (M), Quartile (Q), and High (H). Higher error correction levels allow more data to be recovered but reduce the overall data storage capacity.

### Decoding Process
Decoding a QR code involves unmasking the code and extracting the indicator and length fields to retrieve the encoded message.

## Security Risks of QR Codes

Despite their usefulness, QR codes are susceptible to security risks, such as:

- **Malware Attacks**: Malicious actors can alter publicly available QR codes to infect devices with malware.
- **Financial Theft**: Fraudsters can replace legitimate QR codes with fake ones, redirecting payments to their own accounts.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of secure encryption methods in mobile payments. Public-key encryption, combined with QR codes, offers a robust mechanism for safeguarding sensitive information during transactions. However, attention must also be given to the potential security risks associated with QR codes.
